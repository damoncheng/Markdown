##Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects 


Using axiomatic specifications and our notion of linearizability, we can reason
about two kinds of problems:

- We reason about the correctness of linearizable object implementations using
new techniques that generalize the notions of representation invariant and
abstraction function [18, 251 to the concurrent domain. 

- We reason about computations that use linearizable objects by transforming
assertions about concurrent computations into simpler assertions about their
sequential counterparts.
